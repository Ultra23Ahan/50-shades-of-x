# Hello!

This is a small project i worked on, where you can input any color and it wll give 50 shades of that color.

### Why I made this:

I made this because I saw somewhere that somebody made a book called 50 shades of grey(not gray), which was literally just 50
shades of gray. So i made this!

### Things

Supports css common color names like red, azure, lightyellow, goldenrod, etc.<br />
Supports hex<br />
Supports rgb<br />
Supports hsl<br />
(sorry no olkch maybe later)<br />

Scroll up to see lighter shades, and scroll down to see the lighter shades of the color you inputted.<br />
Click on one of the color format methods to copy it to your clipboard.
