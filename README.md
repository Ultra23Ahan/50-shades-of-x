# Hello!

This is a small project i worked on, where you can input any color and it wll give 50 shades of that color.

### Why I made this:

I made this because I saw somewhere that somebody made a book called 50 shades of gr**e**y(not gray), which was literally just 50
shades of gray. So i made this!(because why not)

### Important points

- Supports css common color names like red, azure, lightyellow, goldenrod, etc.

- Supports hex

- Supports rgb

- Supports hsl
(sorry no olkch but maybe later?)

Scroll up to see lighter shades, and scroll down to see the lighter shades of the color you inputted.
Click on one of the color format methods to copy it to your clipboard.
